# pps_gui_emu
This code is the GUI for a Physical Programming Simulator which can be used as an aid to learn Python programming skills.  The graphical front end is based on the guizero wrapper to tkinter and requires the emulator / bridge code to be imported into the program using it. This application is based on work by primeteacher.
